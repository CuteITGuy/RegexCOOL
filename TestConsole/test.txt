This method is implemented by using deferred execution. The immediate return value is an object that stores all the information that is required to perform the action. The query represented by this method is not executed until the object is enumerated either by calling its GetEnumerator method directly or by using foreach in Visual C# or For Each in Visual Basic.
This projection method requires the transform function, selector, to produce one value for each value in the source sequence, source. If selector returns a value that is itself a collection, it is up to the consumer to traverse the subsequences manually. In such a situation, it might be better for your query to return a single coalesced sequence of values. To achieve this, use the SelectMany method instead of Select. Although SelectMany works similarly to Select, it differs in that the transform function returns a collection that is then expanded by SelectMany before it is returned.
In query expression syntax, a select (Visual C#) or Select (Visual Basic) clause translates to an invocation of Select.
